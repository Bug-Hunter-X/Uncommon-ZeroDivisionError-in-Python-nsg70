# Uncommon ZeroDivisionError in Python

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error scenario related to zero division in Python.
The function `function_with_uncommon_error` attempts to handle cases where either 'a' or 'b' is zero, but fails to explicitly handle the case where both are zero simultaneously.
This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes, highlighting the importance of robust error handling.
